+ ### Explanation
  - As it is obvious, when we use cache decorator. 
  Computer doesn't recalculate repetitive values. 
  Once the calculation is done for a part of a program, 
  In the next calculations, program just uses what has calculated before
+ ### Result
  - #### Using cache makes calculations and process really fast.



+ ### Result of testing
