# 2nd solution
1. We don't need the file to be opened in the entire process.
   so I closed it right after that I read the numbers.

2. We want to have the None for each exceptions in the list
   not that we assign all the members of the list None.
   so I add a for above the try & except block.
   and for each member of numbers that has an error I assign
   None for that member in result
   if I found that right â˜º I don't know
